# Problems solved with Python 3

The goal of this repo is to show my progress as I learn a new programming language. This repo is exclusive for Python 3.

## Executing

You should have python3 installed. 

```
python3 file_name.py
```

## Folder's organization

Basically, each folder is a problem. Inside them, you'll find a Readme.md file explaining the problem and 1+ .py files each with different solutions. This is just a list of which problems you can find in the repo.
